This collection creates the decision log. \nThe decision log provides the project context as well as detailed implementation and design information. \nProject members skim the headlines of each ADR to get an overview of the project context. They read the ADRs to dive deep into project implementations and design choices.\nWhen the team accepts an ADR, it becomes immutable. If new insights require a different decision, the team proposes a new ADR. \nWhen the team accepts the new ADR, it supersedes the previous ADR."}, {"type": "ADR", "date": "2022-06", "title": "Example ADR", "link": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/architectural-decision-records/appendix.html", "summary": "This decision defines the software development lifecycle approach for ABC application development."}, {"type": "Memo", "date": "2022-12", "title": "Best ADR Practices", "link": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/architectural-decision-records/best-practices.html", "summary": "Promote ownership.\nPreserve ADR history.\nSchedule regular review meetings.\nStore ADRs in a central location.\nAddress non-compliant code."}, {"type": "Memo", "date": "2023-12", "title": "ADR Resources", "link": "https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record", "summary": "Architecture decision record (ADR) examples for software planning, IT leadership, and template documentation"}, {"type": "Talk", "date": "2024-04", "title": "ADR: The Basics", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gqn2dbt_JY", "summary": "This video describes the basic idea and implementation or Architecture Decision Records, or \\\"ADRs\\\".
